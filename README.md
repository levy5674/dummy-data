# dummy-phleet-data
just some made up bytes

This is part of a playpen, where I'll have some data that I'll **unpublish** into starphleet, and then a separate service that modifies, pushes, and commits it.

questions

1. Does having local changes for the unpublished psuedo-service break anything?
1. Can the modifying service commit and push
  1. what if there are multiple ships?  do I need to worry about merge conflicts?   should each ship use its own branch?
